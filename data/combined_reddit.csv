wisakoy,soccer,"credit to u/boskee for translating article on r/barca *on first impressions of fc barcelona**

looking at how we are playing and how interesting the project is developing, i have a lot of reasons to smile and be happy. i enjoy coming to the national team training camps. it's just that the weather is a bit different to catalonia. a lot has changed with me over the last few months, but i'm happy. performing for the national team is nothing new, i enjoy coming to the national team meetings and even after a long break, it's always an event. i'm at an interesting point in my career.

previously i was at the training camp in june and my situation was different. i was aware of the moment in my career and the challenge i was facing. i was in the process of changing clubs, but that didn't prevent me from preparing as well as possible for the nations league matches. i had a smile on my face in training and during the matches.

i had a bit of anticipation and more or less knew what was going to happen at bayern, but it didn't affect the sporting aspect in the national team. i'm an experienced footballer, i've faced a lot in my life, it was easier for me to prepare for everything. after so many years in one country, a change of environment is a novelty that i enjoy and i feel good in a new place.

the road has not been easy, but i am here where i wanted to be. it's an extra incentive that doesn't put pressure on me, but adds lightness and freshness. it's easier to play with a smile. the transfer to barcelona has given me power, increased my sense of worth, i feel pride and fulfilment. i knew i was supposed to decide the outcome of matches and i wasn't afraid of this role. i feel pride, but i didn't expect it to go so smoothly, for the fans at camp nou to start singing songs about me so quickly. it's all made me feel like i've been at barcelona longer than i have. everything has come together beautifully.

what have i learned? i speak spanish better, i can order my own food in a restaurant, i'm learning about the culture, the city and adapting to life. there was a collision with an interesting experience that changed my perspective on life. it's an added value, an interesting lesson that i want to draw on for as long and as much as possible. i feel a breath of fresh air, the opportunity to work with another outstanding coach. it was the right time for a change. *on the match against bayern munich in the champions league**

to be honest, i was not happy to play at the allianz arena so soon. emotionally it was a meeting unlike any other, it cost me a lot, it had a much wider dimension than just sporting. i spent eight years in munich, scored several hundred goals, won everything possible, and suddenly i had to compete with colleagues and friends. i'm only human, it's impossible to walk away from that, i wanted to, but there were question marks in my head. emotionally, it was the toughest match of my life, but i also treat it as a seal to sum up my career at bayern. emotions were bubbling up inside me, i wanted to score a goal, but something wasn't helping inside. it's impossible to forget eight years in a few weeks, but that's behind me now. we shouldn't have lost, if it had been 4:2 or 5:2 for us, nobody would have treated it as a sensation. but it's also a lesson for our whole team: if you can't win, at least tie.

i was not afraid of the reception from the fans. i was already in munich as a barcelona player and i know what the fans i met on the street were saying to me. bayern fans are intelligent when it comes to what is written in the media. they can read with understanding and distinguish the truth from what is not. they know and remember what kind of person i was, how i behaved, what i did, what i said, etc. walking into the stadium, into the changing rooms, warming up on another half of the pitch, - it was a unique experience, for me more than just a match, it was impossible to forget and switch off and mute the emotions. i wanted to win and score a goal, but the emotions were bubbling up inside me. *on the difference between laliga and the bundesliga**

the bundesliga was definitely more physical. in spain a lot more teams try and want to play football. that's how i see it now, but i don't rule out that perceptions will change. we are facing games against teams that will defend. that was the case last weekend against elche (3:0). seemingly the last team in the table, i scored two goals, but we really played hard because the opponent was set up strongly defensively and moved skillfully around the pitch. i don't think about it because i've played so many games against so many different teams from different countries in my life that it doesn't cause me much trouble to adapt to the conditions on the pitch. the most important thing is to quickly find a solution to what you found on the pitch. what is important is the huge potential we have in barcelona. this breath of fresh air makes me want to develop all the time, to move forward. i feel like i have been given new energy. *on fc barcelona's young players**

i don't feel like i'm their guru, but i realise that they are receptive to knowledge, willing to talk and not shy to ask. i share my knowledge and experience with them because i see the potential they have, how quickly they can develop. let's remember that there are several experienced footballers at barcelona, and i'm not just one of the elders or just a group of youngsters. coming into a new team i want to have a good relationship with everyone. pedri, gavi, ansu fati, fernan torres - the number of huge talents in one place is unprecedented. i haven't been in such a situation on the pitch or in the changing room yet. although they are very young, they are already showing great skills and will get better very quickly. *on the ballon d'or**

maybe barcelona players have won it more often, but this trophy doesn't give me any sleepless nights. i don't approach it in the way that there is a shorter way to the golden ball from barca than from bayern.

that said, i‚Äôm in the process of picking a team from each league. if you have any suggestions for me, please point them out. here‚Äôs what i have so far:

wrexham: the obvious. this one is a lock.

man city: i‚Äôve also started watching their all or nothing, and i really like the kit man. however, the saudi part is a downside. open to changing this.

real madrid: i know someone who is a big fan and wants me to join. this one is also a lock.

dortmund: i just think the yellow and black is cool. could easily switch this one.

psg: messi is the only player i know besides pulisic and ronaldo, and i want to watch him and support him before he retires.

atalanta: i live in atlanta, so this one is another easy pick. the name just reminds me of home.

atlanta: lastly, the mls. after the atalanta pick, this shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise. also a lock.

lmk who you would pick if you were in my shoes! once i pick, i will not change any teams out of principle, so it‚Äôs important i get these right. thanks everyone!",i‚Äôm new to soccer and an american fan. please help me figure out who i should be a fan of.

&amp;#x200b; *quotes:** ‚Äúmaybe the idea would be to train with only 10 players on the pitch, because ligue 1 referees have decided we have to play with 10‚Äù*

\~ √≥scar garc√≠a - reims manager

&amp;#x200b; ""it's a hammer blow when you return to the amateur game, and you return to 'normal life'. you have to find yourself a school‚Ä¶ before that, the bus just dropped me off in front of the school. it's really hard to bounce back from such a failure - and for me it was a failure. i started to ask myself, 'why should i bother?'. some people are cut out for this, some aren't. maybe it's not for me. i got quite tearful when i landed my first contract with strasbourg‚Ä¶ and i thought 'wow, this is how it feels to receive an offer from a professional club'! i was ready to sign anything. i didn't even listen to what they were offering me. i just said 'yes' straight away.""*

youssouf fofana - monaco

&amp;#x200b; ‚Äúthere is a lot of disappointment. this outcome is very hard, even more in the current period. coming back, we thought we had done the hardest part but we are faced with all these problems there. i take responsibility for it because if we are there today, i am the first responsible. we will have to do much better, and i should be the first.‚Äù*

\~ julien stephan - strasbourg manager

&amp;#x200b; ""lyon has always had a collective mindset, training players to serve the good of the team. afterwards, their individual quality can stand out. tolisso, fekir, ferri, nji√©, gonalons or lacazette were very good players but were not considered like ben arfa or martial, made for the very top level. a lyon game in training will be focused on collective mastery, whereas in paris individual talent is expressed more, which is also more specific to the psg first team. but these are two great schools of life, of sport. above all, there's a generational transfer. kimpembe played that role, despite everything; in lyon, tolisso and lacazette returned to play the role of big brothers with the youngsters who come through. it's very important to maintain this link, to always be able to hand over to the next generation.""* \~* stephane roche

&amp;#x200b; *deja who?:**  my junior football career took me all over france, and even a brief stint overseas, before finally settling at the french club with whom i would sign my first professional contract and make my ligue 1 debut.  it was a hugely successful period in my club‚Äôs history, with no shortage of silverware, but not without its difficult periods for me and my family off the pitch.  after acrimonious splits with club and country, a move overseas saw more trophies added to my cabinet.  but again, controversy was never far away, even if i eventually patched things up in bleu.

&amp;#x200b;

who am i and what do i have in common with the other two september deja whos?

as a side note, i'll be going by current table order as it's the most comfortable way to list the teams:  real madrid club de f√∫tbol: the most successful team of the country, i don't think this team needs any introduction. we usually call them ""el madrid"" (nothing about real, sorry boys). as a fun fact, they were given the nickname ""real"" (""royal"") by king alfonso xiii, which was then removed during the second republic, and reinstated upon the franco dictatorship  f√∫tbol club barcelona: the second most successful team in the country, with a translated version of ""football club"" due to francoist legislation about team names. they're called ""barcelona"" or ""bar√ßa"", nothing special here  real betis balompi√©: one of the two teams of sevilla, another of the clubs that got the ""real"" distinctive from the king. they're called ""betis""  athletic club: the only team other than bar√ßa and madrid to never be relegated from the league, they're usually called ""athletic"" or, if you want to anger their supporters, ""bilbao"" (during the francoist regime they were simply called ""bilbao"" due to the same rules as bar√ßa, so it reminds them of a time when the basque country was really repressed)  club atl√©tico osasuna: biggest team of navarra, the team from pamplona (the city of the ""sanfermines"") is simply known as ""osasuna"" (meaning ""health"" in basque)  villarreal club de f√∫tbol: with recent european success, this team comes from the small town of villarreal (caution, use two ls and two rs) in castell√≥n. they are simply called ""villarreal""  atl√©tico de madrid: the second most succesful team in the capital city, they are usually called ""atl√©tico"" or simply ""atleti""  real sociedad: coming from san sebasti√°n/donostia in the basque country, this team is known as ""la real"" (just so you know we don't mean madrid when we talk about them)  valencia club de f√∫tbol: a team with some european success some 20 years ago, currently a bit lost, they're called ""valencia""  real club deportivo mallorca: another one of the ""real"" clubs, they're simply called ""mallorca""  girona f√∫tbol club: along with espanyol and osasuna, one of the few teams with their name not in spanish (catalan in this case), usually known as""girona""  rayo vallecano de madrid: coming from vallecas, one of the towns around madrid, this historically left-wing team is usually called ""rayo"" or, affectionately, ""rayito""  real club celta de vigo: another of the ""real"" teams, the ""celta"" is a reference to the celtic people who lived in galicia befor the roman empire came along, they're simply known as ""celta""  getafe club de f√∫tbol: from another town around madrid, they're known as ""getafe""  sevilla club de f√∫tbol: the other team from sevilla, eternal rivals to betis, they're just called ""sevilla""  uni√≥n deportiva almer√≠a: experiencing relative success in recent times, with several promotions to the first division, this andalusian team is usually known as ""almer√≠a""  real club deportivo espanyol: another ""real"" club, eternally the second team from barcelona (though they play outside the city nowadays), they go by ""espanyol""  real valladolid club de f√∫tbol: from former spanish capital city valladolid (we're talking about centuries ago though), this team is known as ""valladolid"" or ""pucela"" (another way the city is known, not really clear why it's called like that)  c√°diz club de f√∫tbol: another andalusian city, the team is simply ""c√°diz""  elche club de f√∫tbol: from the town of elche, in alicante, this team is called ""elche""

we're done with laliga, let's go to the second division (laliga 123), here i'll skip the obvious ones (for instance, deportivo alav√©s is just ""alav√©s""):  uni√≥n deportiva las palmas: from the canary islands, they're usually known as ""las palmas"" or ""la uni√≥n""  albacete balompi√©: one of the few big teams from castilla-la mancha, they're known as ""albacete"", ""alba"" or ""el queso mec√°nico"" (a reference to ""manchego"" cheese and a clockwork orange, since the 70s netherlands team is known as ""la naranja mec√°nica"")  sporting gij√≥n: one of the two biggest asturian teams alongside real oviedo, they're usually known as ""sporting""  racing santander: in a similar fashion, this cantabrian team is known as ""racing""

this is it for professional football, let's quickly go through the semi-professional ladder (1 rfef, 2 rfef and 3 rfef) to find some interesting cases:  racing ferrol: curious case, just like racing santander they can be called ""racing"", just the santander team is more prevalente, so in case of confusion this team goes by ""racing ferrol""  real madrid castilla club de f√∫tbol: real madrid's youth team is known as ""castilla"", as a fun fact they have won one copa del rey against their ""parent"" team  real club deportivo de la coru√±a: historically one of the big teams of the country, nowadays in a difficult situation, this galician team is known as ""deportivo"" or ""d√©por""  cultural y deportiva leonesa: from the city of le√≥n, this team is known as ""cultural leonesa"", ""cultural"" or ""cultu""  uni√≥n deportiva san sebasti√°n de los reyes: from another town around madrid, this team is usually known as ""sanse""  unionistas de salamanca: ""homage"" team to the already disappeared uni√≥n deportiva salamanca, this team is known as ""unionistas""  uni√≥n deportiva and sociedad deportiva logro√±√©s: both teams are from logro√±o, both appear after the historical team cd logro√±√©s disappears. i think all three teams are known as ""logro√±√©s"", which is a great deal of confusion, ngl  real uni√≥n club: from the basque town of irun, in the frontier with france, this team was one of the founders of the league, and is known as ""real uni√≥n""  club gimn√†stic de tarragona: another club whose name is in catalan, they were in the first division about fifteen years ago. they're called ""n√†stic"" or ""gimn√†stic""   polideportivo el ejido: this team from almer√≠a is a pretty funny case, as their name is contracted to ""poli ejido""  yugo-uni√≥n deportiva socu√©llamos club de f√∫tbol: pretty strange name for a team from socu√©llamos, in ciudad real. i've heard them called both ""yugo"" and ""socu√©llamos""  deportivo fabril: d√©por's youth team, they're usually known as ""fabril""  salamanca club de f√∫tbol uds: honestly the only reason i've gone this down the ladder, and apart from my obvious bias (see my flair) i think this story is interesting: in 2013 the historical team from salamanca, uni√≥n deportiva salamanca (known as ""el salamanca"", ""la uni√≥n"" or ""la uds"") disappeared. from that, two teams appeared in the city: unionistas de salamanca, which we have already discussed as a ""homage"" club (as a fun fact, it's initials spell out uds), and cf salmantino, an attempt to ""preserve"" the old team through its youth team. years go by, and salmantino buys the old team's stadium, the anthem and the badge, and renames to salamanca cf uds (uds technically not meaning anything since they don't have a right to be called ""uni√≥n deportiva salamanca""). in general, a pretty similar situation to logro√±√©s, only the names are more distinguishable  dux internacional de madrid: i'd like to finish off with a very curious case. you won't find this club anywhere on the spanish football ladder, as they've been the protagonist to some drama this year, as the club has essentially bankrupt. formerly known as internacional de madrid, the team was bought out by the esports team dux gaming, being known as ""dux"", ""dux inter"" or ""inter de madrid""

that's all, please correct me anywhere i may have been wrong, and tell me about anything i may have forgotten, i'll have no problem adding it to the post!",[oc] how to call the football teams from spain
Lethal-Sloth,soccer,"[click here to see a breakdown of supporters within each country](https://imgur.com/a/balxi4z)

disclaimer: don‚Äôt take this as hard and fast super accurate data. this was a little difficult to find info for and doesn‚Äôt seem to be a question that‚Äôs actually asked all that much. please note that for brazil, the other section *includes* people who aren‚Äôt interested in football (22% of the whole pie chart), whereas the french one specifically *only* includes answers from football fans. **the poll for the uk asked the whole of the uk** so that includes scottish teams (celtic and rangers weren‚Äôt in the top 10 though) - scotland‚Äôs population is about 8% of the total in the uk (and england a little over 80%). the other polls were not clear on exactly who they asked, so be aware of that. additionally polls weren‚Äôt all taken at the same time.

i have looked at the breakdown of supporters of football clubs, in the country where that club plays. so the support of english football clubs by english people, french football clubs by french people, etc.

the takeaway for me is that the uk really seems to lack 1 or 2 ‚Äòmassive‚Äô clubs who claim the vast majority of the support between them, although man u and liverpool are clearly a bit ahead. other countries tend to have 2 or 3 dominant clubs who may claim over half of the people in that country as their fans . [portuguese fans tend to support one of the ‚Äòbig 3‚Äô even if they have their own local team](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781351117982-4/nonlocal-portuguese-football-fans-love-big-three-boris-osorio-craig-hyatt) who they also support (...i had a much better source for this that i can‚Äôt find right now. i‚Äôm sure some portuguese can correct me if they disagree). my anecdotal experience in the uk is that fans of lower league clubs (at least in the top 3 or 4 tiers) are unlikely to support a second ‚Äòbig‚Äô club (although obviously any football fan has certain teams they would like to win or lose more than others!).

regardless of the colour of your shirt (or the flair next to your username) we are all living, breathing human beings - and we all love the beautiful game. everyone on /r/soccer deserves to be happy and well - so be kind. it can be a tough old world out there, and that kindness can go a long way.

djembejohn,soccer,"throughout the season, some questions are always there, at the back of our minds. could it be a title this season? do we have a chance of europe? are we safe from relegation? why am i up thinking about this at 3am?

as i write this, it‚Äôs just six games into the 2022 season. arsenal and brighton are flying high, but west ham and leicester are propping up the table. is it too early to know what‚Äôs going to happen? i looked at previous seasons to see what i could find out.

for every premier league season since 1997, i looked at the league table after 6 matches. for each position in each of those tables, i then looked at where the team finished at the end of the season. each dot on the chart shows each of these data points. as an example, i have highlighted tottenham who [were in 11th last season after 6 games](https://www.worldfootball.net/schedule/eng-premier-league-2021-2022-spieltag/6/), but finished 4th. the lighter the colour, the more often teams finished in that position. 

https://preview.redd.it/unn0ouymu8o91.png?width=1139&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77c8eff2403da1e66c8a973e326574e5bbbed97

what does this mean? well, starting at the top of the league (top left), your chances of winning the title are slim if you‚Äôre not placed in the top two by now. in terms of qualifying for the ucl, you should be in the top half of the table. only seven times has a team in the bottom half of the table made it to the ucl. similarly, only three times has a team in the top half been relegated. if you‚Äôre in the bottom three things look bleak, but you still have a 8/15 chance of surviving.

thanks for reading! i‚Äôm planning to do more in the future so if you liked it follow my new twitter account [@statsgrizzle](https://twitter.com/statsgrizzle).",where is my (epl) team going to finish at the end of the season? this post will tell you what's likely!

GunsAndGlitterX,soccer,,"help recognizing signature! april 8, 2006 when i was little i attended a red bull dinner in nyc, got this ball signed by a pro, does anyone recognize? assuming european player because of how date is written. he was there with franz beckenbauer."
try-D,soccer,,[livescore] 10 g/a in his last 9 premier league games; still no england call-up for james maddison
manchesthairy,soccer,"i feel bad for all the young ones who never saw him in his pomp. to me, he had the technique/ability and the drive of ronaldo to put in terms that our young american friends can understand.  sublime technique, impossible to knock off the ball, incredible vision, and unquestionable leadership.   but enough about my opinion, this is what some of his contemporaries had to say about diego

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

\- ""even¬†if i played for a million years, i'd never come close to maradona. not that i'd want to anyway. he's the greatest there's ever been.""¬†-- lionel¬†messi.

\-- ""no ball ever had a better experience than when it was at his left¬†foot."" --¬†argentina teammate jorge¬†valdano.

\-- ""diego, for all argentinians, is god. and he always will be.""¬†-- carlos¬†tevez.

\-- ""what (zinedine) zidane could do with a ball, maradona could do with an¬†orange.""¬†-- michel¬†platini.

\-- ""the best of the lot, no question... i saw maradona do things that god himself would doubt were possible.""¬†-- former brazil star zico.

\-- ""the best i ever played against was¬†maradona."" --¬†former ac milan and italy defender paolo maldini.

\-- ""he was a model of good¬†behaviour¬†on the pitch.¬†he was respectful of everyone, from the great players down to the ordinary team member. he was always getting kicked around and he never complained, not like some of today's strikers.""¬†-- maldini.

\--¬†""maradona.¬†when he was on form, there was almost no way of stopping him.""¬†-- former ac milan and italy defender franco¬†baresi, when asked who was the best player he faced.

\-- ""maradona is a god to the people of naples. maradona changed history. in 80 years, we had always suffered, fighting against relegation, yet in seven seasons with him we won two leagues, a uefa cup, two italian cups. i'm a fan too and to live those years with maradona was incredible."" --¬†naples native fabio cannavaro, who was in the youth ranks at napoli when maradona was there and later won the world cup with italy in 2006.

\-- ""the best player i've seen in my life. a genius.""¬†-- former ac milan and france defender marcel¬†desailly.

\-- ""the best player there has ever been, better than pele.""¬†-- ruud¬†gullit.

\-- ""when diego scored that second goal against us, i felt like applauding. i'd never felt like that before, but it's true... it was impossible to score such a beautiful goal. he's the greatest player of all time, by a long way.""¬†-- england's gary¬†lineker remembers the 1986 world cup quarter-final.

\-- ""for maradona to win a world cup on his own, and let's face it, that's what he did as the rest of the team were ordinary, was an amazing achievement. he was the best player i've seen."" -- england's glenn hoddle.

\-- ""the crucial difference with pele is that maradona wasn't surrounded by great players; he had to carry the team himself. if you took maradona out of¬†argentina,¬†they would not win the world cup, but i think brazil without pele would still have won.""¬†-- eric¬†cantona.

\--¬†""he only wanted the ball. he wasn't about¬†running;¬†he was all about the game... it's difficult to explain exactly what he would do from the noise the ball would make when his foot connected with it to his incredible control and the¬†swerve¬†he could put on it."" -- former teammate mauricio pochettino.

\-- ""in argentine football, there is a before¬†and¬†after¬†maradona."" -- julio¬†grondona, former head of the argentine football association.

\-- ""diego, what planet are you from?"" --¬†argentine television commentator victor hugo morales immediately after the goal of the century against england in 1986.

‚Äúthe best player i‚Äôve seen in my life. he did things that didn‚Äôt seem humanly possible. when he was on top of his game, and even without training that much he was always in form, he was simply impossible to control.  he decided matches alone, carrying average teams like napoli, and argentina in 1986, to glorious achievements. a genius.‚Äù - marcel desailly

‚Äúwith him on the ball, you didn‚Äôt know where he finished and where the ball started.‚Äù - jose mourinho

‚Äúdid he scare defenders? he scared absolutely everybody! you couldn‚Äôt play against him.‚Äù - john barnes

""‚Äúthe best player i‚Äôve ever played against, miles ahead of anyone else. as you saw in the world cup quarter-final in 1986, i just couldn‚Äôt get near him ‚Äì all i ever saw was his number 10!  he had a low centre of gravity that shielded the ball, he had strength, pace and his passing was excellent. he also had a great leap for such a small man, as he showed with his hand of god goal!‚Äù - terry butcher

‚Äúthe most important characters in mythology were (the greek gods) apollo and dionysus. apollo represented reason and dionysus represented emotion.  those who knew maradona understand that he was the worst of apollo, but the best of dionysus.‚Äù luciano de crescenzo",maradona - the greatest of all time

McWaffeleisen,soccer,"hello max,

it's not official yet, but the news was spread all over town: you will follow your old buddy marco to red bull leipzig. we weren't particularly surprised by this development, as it was already the hottest rumor here in m√∂nchengladbach at the end of last year. at the time, none of us could really believe it - how often did you tell us internally for years how competition-distorting this construct was and how much we all had to stick together against it? the rumor was so hot that you even took it up and vehemently denied it in your press conference in january. today we know not only that they were not rumors and that your statements were lies, but also that your desire to switch to this construct was already certain before your public departure.

you sent us a letter in may asking us to publish it. we complied because we were still trying to believe in the good at that time and remembered the first 20 years of wonderful and very successful cooperation with you. there were already some critics at that time who basically distrusted the acting. yes, we deliberately say ""acting"" today. to get straight to the point: we simply no longer believe that you were upright and honest with us at the end of your tenure at borussia.

you never said that you were sick. the word ""burnout"" never came into play from you. and yet, as a media professional, you knew that your appearance at the final press conference would convey exactly that to the soccer world. the outcry and, above all, the sympathy were great. actually, rightly so: a person suffering from a mental stress disorder needs full support and needs help from all of us. but was this also anticipated by broad sections of the public in lay medical terms, just as it was in january? with our current state of knowledge, we must unfortunately state quite clearly that the ""spectacle"" quoted above also applies to this topic. to convey this image of your professional soccer fatigue to the public, while at the same time you are haggling over your departure to red bull, is - we can't put it any other way - simply shabby and a slap in the face of every person actually affected by burnout.

and then you also meet marco rose there. hadn't you always told us in the spring of 2021 how disappointed you were in his decision, also from a human point of view? didn't you always emphasize that you were only holding on to him for borussia, but not because you wanted to continue working with him? what kind of morale is it when his false ambition causes your painstakingly built house of the new successful borussia to collapse like a house of cards, even plunges borussia into a relegation battle and then drives you away from here? and now all is forgotten and forgiven and the dream duo is working together again? you'll say: that's business. the business that made you declare in january that it was destroying you? so you make yourself a stooge of the business because of which you had to leave your supposed heart club overnight in january?

the whole affair has turned shady. was it really worth it? of course it would have been hard to say, ""guys, i'm not going to win any more titles here. i want to go to red bull and win a title there with the soda millions and my old buddy marco."" nobody would have expected these words either, they would have hit us too, but at least they would have been honest! and we would have expected this honesty from you after the unforgettable time between 1999 and 2020, because despite all internal differences you always seemed straightforward and clear to us. especially because in 2011 we passionately showed you the way of our borussia based on our tradition and prevented the so-called ""initiative"". on this basis and with our support, you were able to begin your successful path. but that doesn't seem to be so important to you anymore, although you liked to point out again and again during your tenure ""not to forget where we come from"". by the looks of it, you've forgotten it in the meantime.

and what is really better in leipzig? in the best case scenario, you'll win an emotionless title with an artificial construct (that's what you used to call it, by the way!). look at the pictures of their cup victory. and then compare them with promotion celebrations of traditional clubs, with our pictures of european cup away games, with the real emotion of a naturally grown club. you'll never feel that emotion in leipzig. there will be cold victories, which will be cheered by consumers and customers. you've always been an emotional person and have refrained from celebrating hotly with thousands and thousands. was it really worth it?

we can't wish you luck in your new job - on the contrary! but we do wish that you would start thinking, that you would question all the new outside influences in a few quiet minutes and consider whether you haven't distanced yourself from the max eberl with whom people here in m√∂nchengladbach identified so strongly and who has now landed in the coldest place in the league.

maschera84,soccer,"i'm a seasoned tech entrepreneur (17 years of experience) who's considering a career change and break into the soccer agent world.

i've done tech all of my life, but my heart and soul belong to calcio.

originally from italy, i have quite a few contacts in the space. not a ton, but enough to get started.

the original idea was to study to become a qualified football agent to then build a portfolio of european (with a majority of italian) players to sell globally, predominantly to the mls, canada, saudi arabia and apac.

my mentor agent, who represents top premier league's names, advised me to consider the intermediary route. based on what i understand, it seems like an easier path to take, since my role would be brokering relationships by established local agents and foreign clubs.

again, the goal is to export local talent, ideally towards career end, to emerging markets (take insigne and toronto as a benchmark deal). and make use of technology to get a step ahead.

think like a tech-enabled soccer intermediary to feed talent to up and coming leagues.

is there anyone who got started in a similar fashion and found success?

i know that it's a very hard world to break into, but this doesn't concern me. pretty much any business i've built and exited were in highly competitive niches.

thanks so much for the support and help!

any comment will be so appreciated!",what's the difference between an agent and intermediary?

&amp;#x200b; *the quick hits:**  psg win at home against juventus, then follow it up with a somewhat lackluster win against brest. all the wins, all the points, but yet not enough to stop the dozens of reporters and twitter analysts from saying they should be doing more, or at least rotating the roster. no one will be complaining about neymar though, who continues his tremendous run up to the world cup.  strasbourg does what strasbourg do. 5 draws out of 7 games sees them still winless on the season, but just barely escaping the 4 doom spots. meanwhile, angers finally break the curse, getting a win against a montpellier team that you're just never sure what form they'll show up in. the 3 points isn't enough to get them even close to safe in the ligue, but will at least give them some momentum as they look towards nice this weekend.  rennes begin their european vacation in larnaca (yes, yes, you're so cultured because you didn't have to look up where larnaca is). they fairly easily control the game and rain down shots, but have to rely on a wonderful 93rd minute flying side kick from assignon for the win. back on the domestic side of things, mandanda yet again steps out of the time machine to put on a great show as rennes obliterate poor auxerre. even with the instability so far, rennes have now found themselves in... maybe a european spot? though the battle will be getting tougher with monaco finally starting to wake up, and lille still hanging around.  lens continue their march to the top of the table and all of our hearts, remaining unbeaten so far in ligue 1 as they take a win against troyes. toulouse also get back to their winning ways against reims, being one of the few teams to stop balogun from getting on the scoresheet. or maybe reims was just missing their president, who has been suspended until the end of the year for his tirade against the refs last week.  but who is that coming to steal the loveable underdog status? the kings of brittany in lorient have as good of a weekend as the merlus could ask for. first time ever head coach regis le bris continued to make quite the statement with two more home wins against two teams that aren't pushovers. lorient plow through lyon, causing them to be on the brink of total anarchy. they then follow it up with a highly entertaining match against the canaries. smooth spot kick goals, long bouncing grounders, shots banging off crossbars, even some tears of joy... everyone leaves the stadium happy and lorient add some cushion to their european spot, a full 3 points ahead of the next team. meanwhile nantes will take some solace in a hard fought loss. that loss also is a little easier to swallow after coming out and looking downright dominant in a win against olympiacos earlier in the week.  lyon have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. but don't worry, they only have to deal with psg this weekend.  who else is partly responsible for lyon's bad time? monaco, who seem to be finding their footing both in europe and in france. their midweek affair sees them in serbia where they pull out the slight win, again thanks to some great work by nubel. when the weekend comes they take down lyon, finally getting their first home win for the season against. with psg, lens, and lyon now in the rearview mirror, the schedule will start to get a little easier to handle, which should help monaco continue building momentum.  nice show up to the game in purple, maybe to symbolize the bruises from the beatings the club has taken over the start of the season. luckily, they doubled their wins with the gimmie points that come from playing ajaccio. andy delort scores the gorgeous winner against the team that first put him on the map, hence his... almost bizarre non celebration (though he would make up for it later, [grabbing a bear with some ajaccio fans](https://twitter.com/sportbible/status/1569239591068073984?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw)). nice will hope to continue this trend against the other french punching bag next week when they play angers. they will also hopefully figure out how to score some goals, having scored only 5 so far on the season. that ties them for the 2nd worst offense in the ligue. also, if you haven't already seen the big news stories coming from the nice - koln match, you'll have to go find them yourself. it won't be very hard. here's hoping that one day, probably far off in the future, european matches will be able to take place in france without all hell breaking loose.  marseille keep the tradition alive... by losing in the champions league. it's not a total loss though, they actually play pretty solid for most of the match with tottenham before a bad decision leads to a red card, and eventually doom. in ligue 1, lille get on the board early and look to continue om's woe, but thanks to sanchez's continued hot start, and a wild 28th minute sub for marseille, they storm back into the game and walk out with all three points, their unbeaten streak still intact, and their best start to a season ever. an easy schedule so far has given marseille the time and momentum to build something exciting, now it's up to them to see how far they can take it.

&amp;#x200b; *quotes:** ""we have things to work on, it's normal, this is the champions league. if it was easy, we would have already won it.""*

kylian mbappe

&amp;#x200b; ‚Äúif you‚Äôre asking me what the big difference between france and england is, i‚Äôll tell you that it‚Äôs linked to the refereeing. there‚Äôs never any downtime \[in england\], the game is played quickly and some ‚Äúfouls‚Äù are not whistled, whereas they are in france‚Ä¶ in england, the referees take the time to discuss and explain the foul to you. they‚Äôre much more educational, they don‚Äôt threaten you with a yellow card when you ask them what‚Äôs going on. when i was new there, the referees came to see me before the match, called me by my first name and said: ‚Äúnice to meet you‚Äù. in france, we‚Äôre no longer allowed to talk to the referees and i find that harmful. i‚Äôm in favour of them having microphones, it would restrict both the players and the referees. in rugby, it‚Äôs magnificent. it would give a new dimension to football.‚Äù*

pierre lees-melou - on ref's

&amp;#x200b; ""i regret it, these days you can't have a laugh. it was a joke at the wrong time. but believe me i am concerned about the planet's problems. i know the responsibility we have. i've heard that we're disconnected, that's not the case. the joke was in bad taste. but to turn it into a scandal and make us look like something we're not... my players care a lot about the climate, the club cares a lot about that.""*

christophe galtier - having to ridiculously apologize about a bad joke, while also clearly lying about how much psg cares about climate change

&amp;#x200b; ‚Äúif i‚Äôm under pressure? no, not at all. why would i be under pressure? explain it to me. i know we‚Äôve just lost two straight matches, that can happen. monaco is a good team but we were better than them. unfortunately it didn‚Äôt show on the scoreline, but i don‚Äôt think we deserved to lose. normally, if you play like that you get at least a draw, at least. we were beaten by two free-kicks, by the fact we couldn‚Äôt convert our big opportunities, especially at the end. i saw a team that played well, with confidence and with a good mentality.‚Äù*

peter bosz - lyon head coach

&amp;#x200b; ‚Äúi don‚Äôt appreciate subbing a player it that way. it wasn‚Äôt because he was playing badly, i just got the impression that the referee was willing to give out cards and leo risked getting a second booking. i didn‚Äôt like the fact that he was whistled, it‚Äôs not nice to whistle your own players. especially since he‚Äôs a good guy, he always gives the maximum.‚Äù*

igor tudor - on benching leonardo balerdi after just 28 minutes

&amp;#x200b; ""i think our sports minister has summed it all up. he's had enough. when you experience it live it's terrible. when you experience it again the day after for a second time, with hindsight, it's even worse because you see the terrible images. it's no longer possible. it's not possible. football is a sport, a game. we welcome families and children. it's no longer acceptable.""*

jean-pierre riv√®re - nice chairman

&amp;#x200b; *deja who?:**  born in the suburbs of paris.  i‚Äôm a product of the famed national academy at clairefontaine and i made my professional debut at just 16 years of age.  lightning quick on the pitch, my career went every bit as fast and at just 21 i had already won a league and cup double, the champions league, and the euros.  while my long and successful career probably never re-scaled those dizzy heights, i did secure another 3 national league titles in three different countries as well as two more cups.  but in my home land, i remain best known for one of the darkest hours in national team history

&amp;#x200b;

who am i, and what ended my international career in bleu? (if you post an answer, put it in spoilers text)

SzGabriel,soccer,,5 years ago: one of the most underrated saves of all-time happened in football.
oopsthisisawkward,soccer,"i suspect this might get taken down (sorry mods!), but while r/soccer is talking about responding to cardiac arrest, it could be worth putting some information out there.

the first thing to note: **bad cpr is much better than no cpr.** even if you have no idea what you're doing. even if you've only seen cpr in movies. until someone with more knowledge is ready to take your place, anything you are capable of doing could be the difference that saves somebody's life.

the second thing is that not all of us will have a world class athlete on hand to run over a defibrillator. in the absence of your own personal jeremias ledesma, consider **owning a defibrillator**. they cost around $200 - if you're able to purchase one please do. at the very least, **learn how to use one!**  *the average survival rate when experiencing cardiac arrest is a bit over 10% - to around 60% when someone nearby has access to a defibrillator. god forbid you ever have to, but knowing how to use a defib saves lives.**

if nothing else, this is [how to use a defibrillator](https://youtu.be/ufvl7wtfzl0), here's a resource on [cpr for children](https://youtu.be/0av9ns0ogim), here's one on [identifying a heart attack](https://youtu.be/gdwt7dd3awc), and finally [how to give cpr](https://youtu.be/rmd7ob_wteu).

here's the short version, some countries will have slightly different standards - but no one will give a sh!t.   make sure the person isn't in further danger - moving them isn't ideal, but neither is both of you getting hit by a car.  **give their shoulders a firm squeeze**. this lets you check for signs of life *without looking for a pulse.*  on that note. don't look for a pulse. you probably won't find one - and might actually just feel your own instead - so don't waste your time.   have someone else **call an ambulance**. if no one is available, set the phone on speaker next to the person's head and start cpr.  similarly, if someone else is nearby, have them go look for a defibrillator. depending where you live, certain buildings and workplaces may be required to own them - so find out.  **check their airway** first, listen for breathing. if you can't hear anything, make sure there's nothing in the person's mouth and **tilt their head back**.  put the heel of your hand on the person's lower sternum - about between their nipples - put the other hand on top of the first and **push down about 1/3 of the way or 5cm/2inches**. do this **once a second** for 30 seconds.  no one gives a crap about their ribs when they've just survived cardiac arrest. you will not be punished for breaking them. it's upsetting, but do your best to ignore it. you have more important things to worry about.  **lift the chin, block the nose, tilt the head, and give them two breaths** covering their mouth with yours. if you can see their chest rise you're doing perfectly. if you're not comfortable with this *that is completely okay*. cpr compressions without breaths is still much better than nothing.  repeat this until an ambulance arrives, or dispatchers tell you to stop - or the person is breathing on their own! *sh!t cpr is infinitely better than no cpr.**

i‚Äôm trying to get into the mls, seems like an entertaining league with exciting matches. 

in europe i‚Äôm supporting sporting from portugal, they have a great youth set-up, a passionate fanbase and always have exciting young talents who break through. (from other teams but also from their academy)

i‚Äôm looking for something similar in the mls, a team where i can be ‚Äúproud‚Äù of the talent we have/develop, not the richest/strongest team but strong enough to compete and develop further. (preferably a good project)

also, what can i expect from the mls considering i only watch european leagues?",which mls team to support

here i have made a ‚Äòfamily tree‚Äô of kit colours, where applicable. if your club is not on here it means that most likely the colours came from another source (often local colours, philosophical meaning, or merely that the local town had an abundance of material of that colour).

---

‚Äòunknown‚Äô - often just means no particular reason. also lighter colours were popular at the time as they were cheap and widely available. kits were generally an expense in the early days, as opposed to today where they are used for marketing and are sold to fans, and teams would reuse kits or look for cheap options, sometimes changing colours between seasons if they didn‚Äôt have a particular colour associated with them. the kit market, and clubs being associated with a colour, is relatively recent.

many colours are based on flags or emblems of local areas or cities where the club is based.

in the early days, it was rare (for english teams at least) to wear a badge on their shirts except on special occasions (cup finals usually). so shirts were made without badges.

---

i suggest you control + f (or whatever mobile equivalent is) to find your club in the list below. all pl clubs, some interesting countries and a selection of other international clubs are included.

here is a mini selection of 6 (7) of my favourite kit origin stories, if you can‚Äôt be bothered to look through the list below.



team | colour(s) | story behind colour | year
----|---------|-------------------|----
nottingham forest | red | giuseppe garibaldi was an italian freedom fighter, military general and naval captain who played a large part in the unification of italy in the 1800s. he was very popular in britain, in part due to his opposition to the pope. the ‚Äòredshirts‚Äô (so called due to their red shirts) were italian freedom fighters who followed garibaldi, and it is that red which nottingham forest chose to adopt, originally in the form of red caps before moving to a red shirt. | 1869
west ham | claret and blue | in 1899 bill dove, the father of a west ham player, went to a fair in birmingham. bill dove was a professional sprinter and was challenged to a bet by 4 aston villa players - that they could beat him in a race. he subsequently beat all 4 of them, but they didn‚Äôt have the money to pay so instead gave bill dove a complete set of aston villa kits. bill dove gave these kits to his son, and west ham play in those colours to this day. | 1899
blackpool  | orange | blackpool switched to their tangerine kits after a recommendation by referee albert hargreaves, who had been impressed by the netherlands‚Äô kit while officiating one of their games against belgium | 1923
psv eindhoven | red and white | these colours were chosen at the founding meeting by jan willem hefkes, who apparently noticed the contrast between his red raspberry drink and white notepad | 1913
athletic bilbao/atletico madrid | red and white | they originally played in blackburn‚Äôs colours (blue and white). in 1909, a young spanish student by the name of juan elorduy studying in london was asked by the club to buy 25 new shirts, but could not find enough. about to board the ship from southampton back to spain, he realised that the local colours of southampton matched the colours of the city of bilbao, and bought 50 shirts to take home with him. bilbao quickly adopted the new colours, and half of the shirts were kept for use by bilbao and half were sent to the capital to be used by atletico madrid, formerly a youth team for bilbao. this colour combination was cheap to create in spain, as the same combination was used to in the production of bed mattresses and the leftover cloth could be converted into football shirts. | 1910
boca juniors | blue and yellow | (note this isn‚Äôt sure to be accurate) in 1906 boca played against nottingham de almagro (basically the only record i can find of this team is this game). both teams had the same kit so they agreed whoever lost the match would have to change their kit colours to prevent future clashes. boca lost 3-1 and they headed to the port to choose their new colours, agreeing to select the colour of the first ship‚Äôs flag that came into port. this was a swedish ship and this is where boca (allegedly) got their blue and yellow colours. | 1906

team | colour(s) | story behind colour | year
----|---------|-------------------|----
arsenal  | red | they chose red after a charitable donation from nottingham forest to help the club soon after they were founded. | late 1880s
aston villa | claret and blue | taken from north of the border, believed to be a combination of rangers‚Äô and hearts‚Äô colours | 1888
bournemouth  | red and black | the kit was based on the ac milan colours. they also adopted the name ‚Äòafc bournemouth‚Äô so as to always appear first in an alphabetical list of english clubs. | 1971
brentford  | red and white | unknown  | 1925
brighton and hove albion | blue and white | blue and white chosen as these are ‚Äòseaside‚Äô colours | 1904
chelsea  | blue | original (paler) blue was taken from the racing colours of the then president earl cadogan, before later being replaced by the current royal blue. | 1912
crystal palace | red and blue | the original colours were claret and blue, adopted after aston villa donated a set of kits in the early years. in 1973 they updated their shirts to red and blue under manager malcolm allison. it is thought that perhaps this colour choice was partly influenced by barcelona, although crystal palace‚Äôs website suggests this was merely taking up an old kit that was used as a one-off in the 1937/38 season. | 1973
everton  | blue | unknown. a few years after introducing the current royal blue colour, the club attempted to switch to sky blue in 1906 but fan protests led to the colour being reverted. | 1901
fulham | white | unknown | 1903
leeds  | white | introduced by don revie in an attempt to encourage players and fans to believe that the club could be as successful as real madrid | 1962
leicester city | blue | unknown | 1904
liverpool  | red | red was chosen in order to play in the city‚Äôs municipal colour. originally, they played in blue after playing in kits everton left behind when moving out of anfield. in 1964, they moved to an all red kit as manager bill shankly thought it would make his players look more scary to the opposition. | 1896
manchester city | sky blue | this was the main colour of freemasonry at the time. however, wikipedia doesn‚Äôt mention this and says the origins are unclear | 1894
manchester united | red | unknown. at the turn of the century, the club was headed for bankruptcy. legend has it that a st bernard dog belonging to the club captain wandered off from a fundraising event and was rescued by local brewer, john henry davies. learning of the club's plight, davies returned the dog and invested in the club in return for a place on the board. davies brought ambition to the club and in 1902, newton heath became manchester united, adopting red cashmere shirts, white knickers and black socks with blue tops. (http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/manchester_united/manchester_united.htm) | 1902
newcastle  | black and white | originally newcastle played in red, but colour clashes with arsenal/nottingham forest caused them to play in black and white with borrowed kits from notts county. in 1894 they permanently switched to their current colours, partly to appease west end fans (newcastle was essentially a merger of two clubs, west end and east end - read more here: http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/newcastle_united/newcastle_united.htm) | 1894
nottingham forest | red | giuseppe garibaldi was an italian freedom fighter, military general and naval captain who played a large part in the unification of italy in the 1800s. he was very popular in britain, in part due to his opposition to the pope. the ‚Äòredshirts‚Äô (so called due to their red shirts) were italian freedom fighters who followed garibaldi, and it is that red which nottingham forest chose to adopt, originally in the form of red caps before moving to a red shirt. | 1869
southampton  | red and white | while red and white was worn since their formation in 1885, the current red and white stripes were allegedly introduced due to the large contingent of stoke-born players at the club | 1896
tottenham hotspur | white | they chose this colour as they hoped to emulate preston north end. previously they had copied blackburn‚Äôs kit after watching blackburn win the 1884 fa cup final. | 1898
west ham | claret and blue | in 1899 bill dove, the father of a west ham player, went to a fair in birmingham. bill dove was a professional sprinter and was challenged to a bet by 4 aston villa players - that they could beat him in a race. he subsequently beat all 4 of them, but they didn‚Äôt have the money to pay so instead gave bill dove a complete set of aston villa kits. bill dove gave these kits to his son, and west ham play in those colours to this day. | 1899
wolves  | gold and black | these colours were chosen to allude to the city council‚Äôs motto, which was ‚Äòout of darkness cometh light‚Äô, with the gold representing the light and the black representing the darkness | 1891

burnley  | claret and blue | paid homage to football league champions aston villa, believing it might bring luck | 1910
middlesbrough  | red and white | the white strip, previously introduced by jack charlton in 1973 following an attempt to change the home shirt to a leeds united-style white shirt, was added permanently by a vote | 2008
millwall  | dark blue | chosen to pay homage to the scottish roots of the club, with most of the original squad being from dundee | 1885
norwich city | yellow and green | they began to play in these colours to pay homage to their ‚Äòcanaries‚Äô nickname, as rearing canaries was popular at the time. previously, they had played in blue and white. (the kit colour came from the nickname, not the other way round!) | 1907
notts county | black and white | the black and white stripes were inspired by the racing colours of the duke of portland, and were introduced due to frequent colour clashes. | 1890
sunderland  | red and white | shirts were donated by local, now defunct, club south bank fc. | 1887
preston north end | white | unknown  | 1887

scotland  | dark blue | scotland got their blue colour from queen‚Äôs park, who at the time wore dark blue jerseys. queen‚Äôs park initiated the first ever international fixture when they played england in glasgow, and hence the dark blue was adopted as scotland‚Äôs colour. | 1872

--- *dutch teams**

ajax  | red and white | originally a red and white striped kit, based on the colours of the flag of amsterdam, ajax were forced to change upon being promoted to the first division in 1911 as rules at the time stipulated that a promoted team‚Äôs colours could not clash with a team already in the division, and sparta rotterdam already had a red and white striped kit | 1911

athletic bilbao | red and white | they originally played in blackburn‚Äôs colours (blue and white). in 1909, a young spanish student by the name of juan elorduy studying in london was asked by the club to buy 25 new shirts, but could not find enough. about to board the ship from southampton back to spain, he realised that the local colours of southampton matched the colours of the city of bilbao, and bought 50 shirts to take home with him. bilbao quickly adopted the new colours, and half of the shirts were kept for use by bilbao and half were sent to the capital to be used by atletico madrid, formerly a youth team for bilbao (see below). this colour combination was cheap to create in spain, as the same combination was used to make bed mattresses and the leftover cloth could be converted into football shirts. | 1910
atletico madrid | red and white | see athletic bilbao | 1911
barcelona  | blue and garnet | there are several competing theories. among them are that the colours were the same as the merchant taylor‚Äôs school team (an independent british school in merseyside, where some of the founders went to school - this is the official narrative supported by the club), that they are the colours from ropespierre‚Äôs first republic, that they were chosen as those were the most available colours in pens at the time, that a mother of one of the players (who was making the shirts) had only red and blue material available and that they are based on the colours of joan gamper‚Äôs (barcelona‚Äôs founder) home team, fc basel (wikipedia says this is the common perception among catalonians). a lot of spanish teams, including eibar, huesca and levante have copied barca when choosing their shirt colours. | 1900
real betis | green and white | an early player, who studied in scotland to learn english, would regularly watch celtic matches and brought these colours back to spain | 1911
real madrid | white | real madrid took inspiration for their kit from corinthian fc in 1902, an amateur club in london which merged with another club in 1939 and currently plays in the 7th tier of english football. a bit on corinthian fc:¬†corinthian was famed for its ethos of sportsmanship and fair play, and is credited with having popularised football around the world, giving its colour and its name to many other clubs. josh lacey writes that ‚Äúas far as they were concerned, a gentleman would never commit a deliberate foul on an opponent. so, if a penalty was awarded against the corinthians, their goalkeeper would stand aside, lean languidly on the goalpost and watch the ball being kicked into his own net. if the corinthians themselves won a penalty, their captain took a short run-up and gave the ball a jolly good whack, chipping it over the crossbar.‚Äù in the 1880s, most english players played for corinthians and for 2 matches against wales, the entire english team consisted of corinthians players, a feat never repeated before or since by a single club. aside from that, they inspired the creation of sport club corinthians paulista (the extra ‚Äòs‚Äô at the end being the result of a miscommunication), fielded the first black player to play football at an international level, inflicted manchester united‚Äôs heaviest ever defeat (11-3) - and one of their players, wreford-brown, invented the word ‚Äòsoccer‚Äô. among their other famous players was max woosman, referred to as the ‚Äògreatest british sportsman‚Äô, who captained england in football, won a wimbledon doubles title, won an olympic gold in tennis, and beat charlie chaplin at table tennis - despite himself playing with a butter knife versus charlie chaplin‚Äôs bat. another famous player was cb fry, who also opened the batting for the england cricket team, played rugby for the barbarians, held the european long jump record and, in 1920, was offered the throne of albania (which he declined). banned by the fa from competing in the league and cup due to their amateur ideology, corinthian fc decided to tour abroad and brought the competitive game to various countries across europe, africa, north america and south america. despite being amateur, they frequently defeated professional sides in competitions where they were able to play. | 1902

ac milan | red and black | red was chosen to represent their own players‚Äô desire and passion, while the black represented the fear of their opponents. | 1899
fiorentina  | purple | fiorentina were founded in 1926 and played in red and white shirt originally. legend has it that they got this purple colour by mistake after washing their red and white kits in a river and the dye ran | 1928
lazio  | white and blue | based on the colours of greece | 1900
inter milan | black and blue | picked to represent the day and night skies. in fact, the club was established on the 9th of march at 11:30pm. some sources say blue was also selected as it was considered to be the ‚Äòopposite‚Äô colour to local rivals ac milan | 1908
juventus  | black and white | juventus originally played in pink but continual washing faded the colour so they asked one of their english players, john savage, if he could source some new shirts from england. savage had a friend in nottingham who, being a notts county supporter, shipped over notts county shirts to turin | 1903
napoli  | blue | represents the gulf of naples‚Äô blue | 1920s
palermo  | pink and black | in the early days, palermo had mixed fortunes, which led to the selection of pink and black - pink for the matches won and black for the matches lost, described by club founder count giuseppe airoldi as ‚Äúcolours of the sad and the sweet‚Äù | 1905
roma  | red and yellow | these are the traditional colours of rome | 1927

Vcaze11,FIFA,"looking at the meta on earlier titles, you often wanted 3+ wingers in your team as they're often cheaper and better than strikers.  so it's been quite usual to for example move a winger up to st in game and start a winger central on 7 chem and move to the wing. now some players that are wingers by default can be changed to st or cf and will probably mostly be changed and started at that central position. though for example rashford that can play st, he will mostly be used as a st and the market will also take his price to a price as if he was a st.

the 80+ wingers that can play cf or st are:

cf:  mane, foden, tadic, insigne, zaha, rafa, kulusevski, goncalves, grifo, t. hazard

st: torres, danjuma, rashford, terrier, rebic, morales, bowen

not that many notable players tbh but there will be more usable ones with totw and promo cards etc. also it's likely that we will se players get added secondary positions on promo cards. 

there's not too many cf formations, even with the change of 4-3-2-1 and 3-4-2-1 where the earlier lf/rf/winger positions are now cf. i think it's more likely we'll see for example 4-4-1-1, the one with a cf and st. and having let's say zaha as cf.",wingers that can play cf or st

MrDaebak,FIFA,"not because you necessarily like (or dislike) the player but purely in terms of stats. which affordable player is so good in your opinion that you have to put him in your team?

forwards:

i'm not really blown away by forwards. i could say diogo jota but let's be honest, he won't be really affordable early game.

i think gakpo looks incredibly solid as a striker but we will have to see how the game is. he has pace and good shooting. also 4\*4\* which is nice.

muriel is another good one but i remember him being kinda costly in the beginning but wasnt that hard to get a little bit later on.

midfielders:

laimer. he was good last year for starter teams and only looks better since many received a pace downgrade.

merino look really good as well so i might combine them.

gravenberch looks solid, his stats dont look impressive but he has good reach, and great chem for the op early game dutch defenders.

defenders:

timber obviously, he might actually be kind of pricey and maybe even sold out depending on the price cap. teze is a good replacement for him, and geertruida, the leftback can play cb. but that's really early game, his defensive stats arent amazing but the pace and height is there.

frimpong, high pace, chem for bundesliga and the netherlands.

another player from bayern leverkusen is hincapie. he had an amazing promo card in fifa 22. he plays at lb now, but his position change allows him to be put at cb again. with shadow chem he can be at 91 pace. i dont expect him to be expensive at all.",which affordable/cheap early game fifa 23 player do you have to put in your team no matter what?

seksen6,FIFA,"if you want to play fifa online fut is the natural address due to modes, cards, variety, casino effect...etc! the other online mode that online seasons became psg seasons and it is not a surprise to see that; psg is the most meta team. but indeed it kills the variety so badly. plus, separating the player base by stars of the team is not a very good idea as there is already divisions too. this increases to find games.

what if we had a similar system to balance every team at the same level. let's take that you took everton and your opponent has manchester city. this system will equalize the ratings of the teams around same level; it can be fixed on the manchester city, or taking a fixed rating such as 85 for every team. so you will had a chance to compete with everton with your manchester city. i know that it's not realistic but this is a game guys; a banging average right back we all know is the star of this game for years!

ncly9,FIFA,"i‚Äòm not saying it does release on wednesday or thursday but i do think there is a chance 

yes they‚Äòre advertising it as the 26th/27th depending on were you look but here is why i think there is a chance:

- the last couple of years it was always 4 or 5 days before the release of the ultimate edition

- what would be the best economic decision? obviously they want to sell ea play memberships so why wouldn‚Äôt they want the game to exclusively release earlier? and what about fifa points? wouldn‚Äôt they think people spend more in game than in the web app?

- ea is known for its mistakes so maybe they‚Äòre just advertising it for the 27th because that‚Äôs when the ultimate edition releases but it‚Äôs more like a placeholder 

- or they might even want to do a soft launch on purpose to not fuck up the server, i think they‚Äòve done it in fifa 20 as well

batalha11,FIFA,"first of all, i‚Äôve been a fut player since fifa 19 and played career mode from fifa 16 - fifa 20. however, i‚Äôll mainly be talking about my experience in fut. 

i am a free-to-play player, which means that i never spend real money on the game. if i did, opening packs weekly would be less enjoyable. this fifa, which is 22, has been absolutely horrible. now in september, everyone pretty much has the same squads as we all have access to unlimited fodder and the same sbcs. that‚Äôs fun. you may disagree, but it is fun to be able to experience all these top tier cards. 

but, the horrible experience in the game is what i‚Äôll be talking about next. 

firstly, many people play the same way. you may wonder, ‚Äòwhat does that mean?‚Äô most opponents i face incessantly mash their stand tackle button whenever i get anywhere near their players. notice how i said ‚Äòplayers‚Äô and not ‚Äòdefenders‚Äô. yep. people even use ‚Äò36 defending‚Äô strikers to harass my midfielders and stand tackle from behind. the problem is, why do they never concede a foul? i absolutely don‚Äôt understand this phenomenon. you take down my player and get away with it. 

and not just that, i‚Äôve been through on goal and people can catch up and stand tackle or even slide tackle from behind and not give away a penalty, much less alone a booking. it‚Äôs seriously depressing for people like myself that hold jockey forever and try to defend like what a real person defends like in real life. 

add on the fact that the skill spam in this game is quite crazy. i won‚Äôt lie, i do use skill moves time to time to get pass defenders, but some overuse it so much it becomes so boring to play against. no one does that many skill moves in real life! might as well call fifa an arcade game. 

next is the random bounces and rebounds. you can get tackled but somehow the ball is back in front of you, ready for you to shoot. it‚Äôs really dumb, and this only works for the player who the game has currently chosen to side with. that‚Äôs so irritating to deal with. goalies sometimes also save and parry the ball back to the attacker. what is up with that?!

goalkeeper animations/movements: 
most of you know this already. i won‚Äôt go into detail but goalies are so inconsistent and erratic. one game they can save green-timed shots on goal and the next they can concede red-timed shots as the ball phases through their gloves. or they even dodge the ball. 

well done ea. 

also, so many people like to do this same trick to score. dribble with your bloody winger all the way to the end of the pitch and do some sort of pass into my penalty box and tap it in. now, i‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs wrong to do this. do it all you want! but what i don‚Äôt get is how all the defenders perfectly never intercept the ball and actually make a clear path for the ball to be played directly to the attacker waiting to receive the ball. also, what is that pass command you guys use? through pass or a driven pass? whatever, i don‚Äôt care, but i know some of you out there hate this as much as i do. 

now, there are probably many other problems with the game that i may have forgotten to mention, but there‚Äôs something that is the worst of them all which i very much have to address. 

to the fifa community, i implore you, please discontinue your actions and behaviours which display toxicity. don‚Äôt do some stupid twerking celebration when you score or message me obnoxiously when you win. the game itself is already horrendous so don‚Äôt add fuel to the fire.

lastly, i‚Äôve been playing some efootball for the past two weeks and have genuinely enjoyed my gaming experience. so if you‚Äôre also bored of fifa, go ahead and try konami‚Äôs game. it‚Äôs free anyways. 

with that, i wish good luck to all those who have already pre-ordered fifa 23.",i‚Äôm probably not going to buy fifa 23 and here‚Äôs why.

there are far less variants of squads i have seen this year. so wondering what players have you used this year of fut that are rare to be seen?

the best has been mitrovic for me. someone i tried just because i needed chemistry for some of my championship specials. but his if was fucking insane. even now he is great. he is the only player i have used that actually is strong. he might be slow initially but always smooth on the ball. great at winning headers as well as good shooting.

kostic i used from start of the game and used him until end with his upgraded specials. still is great and always is the highest assist maker.

riquelme and ilicic were fantastic as well although after tots they started lacking a bit. which is shame.

the physics, the headers, the keepers, the movements, players without skeleton, no ""small falls""...

but for me the most important is the realism on the pitch and the satisfaction to defend and to score, two things i really miss paying fifa 22.

LegitimateGiraffe243,FIFA,"i think most people still playing already have a method, but here are two i've been using to do the 85x10 without spending any coins.  if you're trying to finish fifa 22 with all the top players, i think its very possible.  i'm not buying fifa 23 so i don't mind spending time doing this. *method 1- open bronze packs + gold upgrade sbc packs + 85x10 + icon moments packs**

step 1 - open a bunch of bronze packs, sell all of the defenders and goalkeepers for 350 or 400 coins.  keep all midfields and attackers.

step 2 - use all bronze midfields and attackers in gold common bronze upgrade packs 

step 3 - alternate between doing the icon moments pack and 85x10s. i'd suggest doing the 91 rated sbc, then two 85x10s, then 89 sbc, then 2 85x10s, then 89 sbc, then 1 or 2 85x10s, then 90 sbc.

sell all special players or consumables you receive worth more than 3k coins from the icon moments sbc packs.  don't sell fut birthday players since they messed up the price range and they're only worth 1k. *method 2 - do several 85x10s using 5-6 90+ special players and the rest bronze or silver players, then complete the icon moments pp.**

step 1 - do 3-4 85x10 packs.  try to use 5-6 special players and have the rest be bronze or silver players.  save gold rare players for icon moments sbc since they usually have better chem

step 2 - do 91 rated icon sbc using rare golds and as few special players as possible.  then do 2 more 85x10s, then the 89 rated sbc, then 2 more 85x10s, then the 89 rated sbc, then 2 more 85x10s, then the 90 rated sbc.

again sell all special players or consumables worth more than 3k.

it's a little tedious, but if you're still playing because you want to get all the best players before the game ends then i hope this helps.  i started out doing method 1, but then switched 2 method 2.  if you sell the special players and consumables from the icon moments sbc your coins will increase a lot, like 150-300k per day.  coins only matter at this point if you're worried about not getting the players you want and having to buy them on the market.",how to infinitely repeat 85x10 and get any player you want

so i only had a dupe benzema sitting unassigned, and when i opened the app just now, ss messi sitting unassigned next to dupe benzema. i haven't gotten a notification or anything about it, but i'd sent all items from my latest 85x10 to club and messi wasn't one of them.

jimmytonyt,FIFA,"there have been murmurs from youtubers and fifa pros of fut champions co-op being added this year, but i am pretty sure this is not true. 

if you check out the pitch notes and refer to the cross-play section, ea specify that co-op is not available in the modes where we are expecting co-op. as below:

- fut division rivals (except co-op)
- fut champions
- fut ultimate online draft
- fut online friendlies (except co-op)
- fut play a friend
- online friendlies
- online seasons (except co-op seasons)

note that there is no need to specify ''except co-op'' next to fut champions, as there will be no co-op option. this also confirms to me that there will still be no option to play 2v2 amongst friends. (which is even more shocking, really).

2. the stadium system. i wouldn't care if half the rewards in the game weren't for stadiums. but i've quite literally played in mine. not once. it's like we're just getting imaginary rewards. and the designing we do is also imaginary. it's a cool system. home teams should play in their own stadium. i don't even understand the reasoning behind any of these choices. 
3. rewards for quitting. no. not like that. you know how to combat cheating? by rewarding the winner. people would 100% stop quitting just to stop others from benefitting from it. even connection losses. give out packs every time your opponent quits. it's irritating. this isn't even a question sorry.

CarryJinx,FIFA,"hello guys, i've been experiencing an issue with fifa 22 since a month or so, i didn't really care about it since i pretty much quit playing, but now that fifa 23 is coming out i'm gonna start playing and the issue im experiencing is probably not going to go away with the new game.

i use an xbox one controller, i have a ds4 controller, and that controller does not have this problem. i also have another xbox one controller, which has the exact same problem, so it's something to do with software. i play the game on steam.

the issue is that whenever i move my left joystick to the right or left, it skips and goes 2 options instead. and whenever i go to the kick-off option, i can see that there is 2 controllers connected ([picture](https://imgur.com/a/ht3b0pb)) to my game however i only have 1 controller connected. the second controllers also seems to follow the first one, so whenever i scroll left on the kick-off screen, both controllers seem to move left, or if i move right, to the right. i have tried the online solutions of adding origin to my steam to start the game, changing steam controller config. settings and trying to update my controllers drivers, however none of them seemed to work.

has anyone experienced this issue and been able to solve it? i'd appreciate any kind of help.",fifa 22 pc double imput / scrolling down glitch

if players get stat boosts on full chemistry and additional boosts from these cards, the need for pace may be reduced.",will pace be less significant in fifa 23?

dear whoever makes fifa, 

i‚Äôll start by saying the obvious you guys clearly do not watch football or have any understanding  of the game or what the fan base wants from a football game/ simulator. 

firstly i would like to address the  issues i have with your lack of understanding of football and the things people would want to see in game 


private league creation :
it‚Äôs a football game you should be able to have a league with friends where you play x amount of matches which the game generate a table and the fixtures   literally how football works, and this is not being able to replicated  this with friends online  such a simple feature that will be more appealing that that adding more playable women teams which less than 8% of the whole of your user base plays 


co op 

co op is 1 dimensional only 5 divs which is really underwhelming you can get to the top rank in like 15 games. also the taking away online cups competitions for co op season what was the reason for this, making a club weather ut or season you want your club glittered with silverwear  

player stats 

nothing is recored in ultimate team &amp;season.words cannot describe how much this makes me angry.  defenders stats show goals instead of clean sheets cannot see how many man of the matches my players get . passes completed  shots on goal the stats that would amerce me in the football im trying to play and give me a emotional connection to my team   the keeper for christ sake shows goals scored how can this be still ignored 

lack of originality with promo 

i really do not have to go into details with this point every year same cards new atal mbabu etc also some promo are silly like the flashback cards and they have no link to previous club where the flashback is fr e.g having a flashback ronaldo that can get green likes to madrid players  or a green link for relatives 


chem styles and position

instead of chem styles maybe add role to the mechanic so you can have a player a role which can be applied to a midfielder like box to box or anchor which would boost the stats needed to play that position and obviously needs to be able to be able to play that role for that position like kante could be either of those roles and would affect how he plays in a givin position


others  

random noises and sound affects 

adding a horse noise literally shows the whole fifa community the ones who make this game have
never been to a football match in their life i have never ever ever heard random noises going off after goals been scored the randomness will be very disrespectful to the person who has a conceded  a goal and is going to make a lot of people anger issues

adding female officials over  a  post game var review  with all the decisions. how many times has a goal to me looked offside and i am unable to check for myself with a replay whether it was on the side of side for obvious reason and the shenanigans of the  game throughout the years it‚Äôs truly hard for me to trust every decision that is made in game and it will probably improve the game if we could report these decisions to you so you could progressively update the ai that‚Äôs giving decisions for example you can report match quality but you can‚Äôt report incidences in game so if hypothetically you got a red card in a game by a poor decision from the referee in the game not necessarily saying you should change the result but you should at least be able to report it to you guys so that you the actual game can be officiate better 


remove momentum and what i call goldilocks zones 


as a person who plays this game i‚Äôm sure you would agree that you‚Äôve been in a situation where you‚Äôre a goal up in the 90th minute with +5 minutes at a time and it seems no matter what you do the ball will always land back to the opposition player and will allow him to continuously shoot until a goal is in. there should be no such thing as a perfect frame perfect moment or perfect opportunity in the game that a player is not crafting on their own everything should be done to make this game simply as fair as possible not favourite players not favouring styles of play and certainly not favouring specific times such as last minute winners last minute equaliser etc

Adventurous_Team285,FIFA,"&amp;#x200b;

1. modes. yeah, moment modes to collect tokens that can be used/saved throughout the year? sounds decent, but at the end of the day, won't be game-breaking. these f2p rewards just won't be amazing, there i say it. remember objectives players of fifa 22? other than a few, many of them are just pure fodder at any stage of the game. on the other hand tho, they didn't mention any modification to the other modes. so sb will still be the same, you will still get relegated from rivals, drafts are still terrible, and play-off, the most meaningless thing of all, still exist.
2. icons. yeah, that's it. i don't think we will have any more coming, as we are two weeks before launch. feels underwhelming isn't it? most of the new ones are a bit bad and won't challenge the big boys that already exist. and, for sure tho, icons won't be fixed in the slightest, so have fun try to score with your scholes/gerrard/lampard, before you realized that rg kdb is probably better than them all.
3. cross-play. cross-platform market, sounds cool enough. but do you really know what that means? do you really think adding pc, the platform with most bots/hacks, would be a good idea? the extinction of needed items would be much more serious. your position cards, chem style, managers from rare nation, will be wiped by bots in a greater extent.

ForeverIndecised,FIFA,"have you ever tried a semi-serious sports game, like the nba 2ks?

in there, if you try to dribble like crazy with your player in a way that doesn't resemble real basketball, your player's stamina will quickly drain and you will very likely lose the ball.

this happens even if you try to dribble with the best dribblers of the game. 

in fifa, i just don't understand how the creators think it's ok to let players make 200 dribbles per second without losing one inch of stamina.

i play fifa because i like real football: tactics, passes, schemes, and so on.

i have nothing against dribbling itself because it's of course a key part of real life football.

but tome, we've reached a state in the past couple of years where playing fifa just feels like playing fifa street, and that's made the game unbearably uglier to me. 

of course, the fact that defending in fifa 22 is possibly the worst of the past 10 years doesn't help either.

am i the only one who thinks this?",the fact that dribbling doesn't have an effect on stamina makes a mockery of how real football works.

JustOneOfThemInnitM8,FIFA,"i've been playing fifa on and off for the past few years and i love the start of the game cycle, grinding through div rivals trying to build a decent team. there's always one or two op players; ben yedder haunted my dreams at the start of fifa 22. overall though there's a pretty even playing field.

later on in the game however, when ea starts dropping stupidly juiced cards for every other player i massively lose interest. i know why they do it, it's so people buy more packs to pack more players to sell to do more sbcs and rinse and repeat. i realise you can do this with the in game rewards from div rivals and weekend league but it takes a little longer. especially as when you're working all the time you don't get nearly as much opportunity to play. i should say at this point i've maybe bought like ¬£20 quid worth of packs each fifa the past few years. 

i realise i'm probably in the minority here but i just think it gets silly when you load into a game against a team with 11 different coloured cards with like 95+ for every stat. in real life football teams are flawed. there are very good players dgmw but not every single player in the world is a football machine built in a lab that is near perfect at everything.

part of me wants to get fifa 23 and go through that starting off stage again but then i think what's the point if i'm going to end up dropping it in a few months when it gets silly again.

career mode is fine but doesn't get nearly the amount of attention it needs. pro clubs is a shell of its former self and again i understand. fut is the money maker but it just makes me sad that this game that i enjoy feels almost inaccessible to me just a few months in.

go to the settings from the main menu -&gt; game settings -&gt; user game play customisation -&gt; increase positioning: marking - user to 100.

sure, there were also bad times(i'm looking at the guys that quit at 0-0 or that play like their lives depend on some friendly games where most people play by golden goal rule), issues with the game, but at the end of the day, i'm pretty happy with my experience in fut 22.

so ea think it's ok to normalise playing a game for 5-10 minutes because we simply don't have time or the attention span? are we really that lazy or busy that we need a microwave minute game mode?
i really don't think it's something we should be encouraging.

i understand it's cool for those that don't want to grind but is that really why they've implemented it? look at how ticktok took off alongside the increase in adhd. obviously i'm aware that adhd is a bit different but we've went from watching 10-20 minute videos on youtube to 30 second ones.

RMASOS,FIFA,"okay, so as far as i can see, there are a lot of people complaining about why ea doesn't add pc market to the shared one together with consoles, and i am here to explain you why is that.  


we all know there are a lot of coins farmers on pc that use cheats to make rank 1 in wl or to get 4 wins prize in draft.  anyone who say otherwise is just  ignorant .

ea added in fifa 23 their new ac called eaac (ea anti-cheat), which is a brand new ac. hooooraaay, all good for now, they finally try to stop cheaters that are rampant on pc's draft and weekend league, right? 

well, i am here to tell you they still don't care about stopping cheaters on pc and i will tell you why.   
\- **in all of their games that are crossplay (bf 2042, apex) they added eac (easy-anti-cheat) to stop cheaters, or at least the majority of them, since no ac will stop all hackers. as far as i know, eac is one of the best ac that exists on pc, together with battleeye.  as we can see, they prefered to add their own ""ac"" instead of eac, and here's the biggest hint that they do not care about cheaters on pc.**  *-eac, even if it's not the perfect ac, still bans the shit out of cheaters, especially those who modify memory of the game. ea knows there are cheaters on pc who use exploits that modify game's memory to achieve wins after kick-off, and they know for sure that patching those on server-side or even client-side, with an actual ac would end this coins farming era.**  


\-**it doesn't have any logic, why did they add eac to bf 2042 or apex who are both crossplay but not for fifa, since they even have a contract with epic to add eac in all of their games if they want to? it's because it would be way easier to let them be isolated on pc, rather than risking to have a shared market between all of them, where hackers can still create bypasses/exploits to get easy wins and farm coins, since like i said, no ac will ever stop all cheaters.**  


\-**now you all ask yourself "" they are confident about their own ac, there is not way they would let consoles players play with pc cheaters "" . well, that's why they added to turn off/on the crossplay, and because they know from millions of players that play fifa on pc/ps5/xbox in the same time, there are slim chances for any actual legit player to meet a cheater. their new ac will most likely be nothing, but something to make console players to feel ""safer"" knowing they added an ac, but they didn't.**  


\-**another reason is because they know xbox/ps coins farmers will move to pc, buy the trainers to farm coins and will destabilize the whole market, like literally.**

&amp;#x200b;

tl:dr : ea possibly added a non-existent ac just to make console players feel safer when they play against pc players, but it won't stop anything.",the real reason ea doesn't add pc to the shared market

how do i emulate that? my team seems... silly. i only have 4 people inside the penalty area (my 4 defenders), and midfields are like 3/4 of the field, not even close to the ball or with intentions to join. maybe one of them joins defense, but if i dont grab manually each of them and bring them to defense they would just look from outside.

went to the controls and noticed that circle only does teammate press. there is no standing tackle option anywhere in that menu. you basically have to walk/run into your opponent and hope you come out with the ball or slide tackle. what????  
if the game doesn't want teammate press and tackle to be the same button (circle) then fine, just let me put teammate press to r1 and leave stand tackle at circle.   


i feel like teammate press sucks cause of tactical defending, idk, my players don't really press. don't even get me started on midfielders, you switch to a defender for 1 second and suddenly your whole midfield starts sightseeing even if they have high defensive workrates.","no standing tackle in legacy defending, y?"

Calvo1,FIFA,,gold kante in a 87+ pp?
deepcx,FIFA,"ok, so the method i used was this:

get rid of fodder into sbcs segments

basically,

1.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†open an 85x10
2.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†submit 5 of the cards from the 85x10 you just opened back into another one. the dupes get priority.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†repeat 1 &amp; 2 for 3 packs in a row.
4.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†you go to the icon player pick, and you put in some of the cards you saved from the previous 3 packs into a segment of the icon player pick. note: dont submit everything you saved from those 3, save as much as you can and make sure to save at least 5 cards to submit into another 85x10.

now, just repeat the process. each segment, has a reward that will give you golds to submit into these 85x10 along with the 5 high rated fodder cards in case you‚Äôre running low on golds.

you can use any sbc not just the icon moments pick. recently, i started submitting 6 of the players i packed in the 85x10 and fill out the rest of the spots with 75-79 gold common cards. this way, it might not be as efficient but i still get 4 fodder cards and it‚Äôs faster.  **how to get gold common cards?**

it‚Äôs simple, with the bronzes or silvers packed from the segments, you just submit them into the gold common upgrade pack. **my results:**

monday - carlos alberto

tuesday - baresi 

wednesday - casillas 

thursday - pel√®

friday -  matthaus 

saturday - rooney 

sunday - cruyff",discussion: i did 7 free icon moments picks and these were my results.

sakr95,FIFA,"there are over 17 000 players and 30 different formations. ronaldo ss can start as lm, lw and lf. that is three different combinations. ginola ss hero can start as st, cf, cam, cm, cdm that is 5 different combinations for for one player. 
between these two players you have 3x5 different ways you can start a game if they are played at 10 chemistry.
that x number of formations that include wingers. 

you can also play a player out of position at lesser chemistry. like ronaldo ss as a gk. 

do you also count chemistry styles?  there are 23 different chemistry styles. 18 for field players.
is this math correct: 1 player x 11 different positions x 30 formations x 18 chemistry styles.

r9 just doesn't make any runs automatically. he seems to be playing along the wings despite having stay central instructions.  he has missed a lot of shots uncontested just outside of the box.  don't get me wrong inside the box he is clinical and if the opponent misses a tackle there he will score. 

he never goes for headers and seems lazy to chase down loose balls (yes he has low aggression)

ea - a french attacking player from the italian league

every time the prize is the the thing you have just strengthened your team with, it makes no sense. would it not be better to reward with a defensive player to strengthen in another part of the team or vice versa depending on the objectives.

or even have a reward which is a card to use in the next objective, a head start to the next one and a reason for people to even play the mode, which most people hate playing already anyway. but some people like me wake up and choose ~~death~~ squad battles.",i hope they change the sb objectives in 23

Affectionate_Dog102,FIFA,"to start, i hate myself for playing this game in august and i hate how much time i've put into building an elite team.

my biggest frustration with ea is the lack of consistency. it's infuriating that gameplay will differ so much from match to match. one game will have you smiling, enjoying the game, and remembering the good qualities of fifa. the next will have prime moments r9 feeling like he gained 1,000 pounds and lost all knowledge of the sport while your opponents players get an upgrade to god mode. experiencing what the game should feel like then having it torn away abruptly. it's the hope that kills me.

every game has its flaws, but you can usually adapt and improve. with fifa, you never know what might be the next issue that sends you into an unhinged rage. 

i feel like i'm a drug addict thats heavily addicted to some life crushing substance except my drug is this damn game. attached is the game that tipped me over the edge and started me on this rant.

LegitimateGiraffe243,FIFA,"like most folks, i have not played draft all year because it is a sweaty garbage mode with bad rewards where you somehow end up having your 2 gold common swiss cbs having to face off against r9 and ronaldinho.  and because i haven't played it all year, i've accumulated 18 draft tokens.

if you're like me, you probably have have plenty of fodder right now but have 0 golds in your club.  if you have draft tokens, you can get a bunch of golds easily.

1. start an online draft using a token
2. choose your captain and then auto-complete the squad (triangle on playstation)
3. select your manager
4. find a match, let your opponent have a goal, and quit (or just quit if you're not feeling charitable)

losing the first match in online draft is usually a reward of 2 gold packs and a silver players pack (i know because i did it 18 times).  occasionally another draft token instead.  gold common packs have 3-4 players in them, so i ended up getting 60+ gold players out of it and a few dozen silvers (and one cheeky tots from a silver players pack).  and 20k from consumables (selling position modifiers).  i did this during batch 1, so you might end up getting more special pulls now that batch 2 has 100 additional players.  took about an hour total but i didn't do it all at once.

or you can play draft if you're feeling up to it, but at this point in the game the team you draft will be infinitely worse than your normal starting squad.  after watching fifa auto-complete 18 draft squads, i can confirm that it is truly an awful mode...but if you've got tokens sitting there, might as well get rid of them.","psa - check your draft tokens, the reward for starting + quitting a draft is usually 2 gold packs and a silver players pack."

these games are suddenly sweatier than fut.

Adventurous_Team285,FIFA,"i am completely aware that a lot of things happened since then, and the fodder state is different. i am also not criticizing those who criticized him when he first came out. but still, at this moment in time, the card is 100% worth it and extremely unique in a sense. 

two reasons for that, first one being his links is brilliant. one of the few great premium futties card that is defensive minded. strong links to rudiger and varane is a massive deal. soft links to other futties attackers which is also insane for squad building. 

then it is his versatility. his maxed out pace means that he can play in almost any position depending on which chem style you put on him. he is probably better than all fullbacks, one of the best b2b, quality as one of two dms, the list goes on.

even before the 85x10 to be 10 times a day and we have a tons of fodder (two-three weeks ago maybe), this was still an amazing sbc to complete. it is still quite crazy see how this most downvoted card become a goat in my and many ppl's club.",ferland mendy turns out to be an amazing sbc to complete

Samoath,FIFA,"post goal celebrations and replays are toxic, so here are a couple of ways ea could make the game less toxic and make us all more mentally healthy while adding value to the game:

tactics review

when an opponent scores, if they choose to celebrate you will be given a short window to implement quick tactical changes to counter their attacks. these changes could include ""mark x tighter"", ""track x's runs"" or ""keeper comes out earlier"". giving us these options would not only induce less rage upon conceiving but also give us more control when the opponent attacks next time.

fifa gallery

instead of watching replays after a goal is scored, any goals that are noteworthy are automatically saved into a separate in-game gallery. from this gallery you can see all your noteworthy goals, filter by goal type and save to your console; all whilst having the same options as instant replay. goals will be automatically saved to the gallery if they meet a criteria such as distance, free kick, flair, etc.

2.  player switching. another reason why a lot of goals happen for this very reason. why do we have to cycle through 2-3 players to get to the one we want and by then it‚Äôs too late.  

3.  menu lag.  this is just utter bullshit that the menu lags so bad in game and takes forever to do anything in game.

let's start by where these players played in greece just so you know:

‚Ä¢ jos√© s√° played in olympiakos
‚Ä¢ r√∫ben vinagre played in olympiakos
‚Ä¢ r√∫ben semedo played in olympiakos
‚Ä¢ micha√´l essien played in panathinaikos
‚Ä¢ marin leovac played in paok
‚Ä¢ danilo pereira played in aris
‚Ä¢ gennaro gattuso *coached* ofi
‚Ä¢ daniele verde played in aek
‚Ä¢ bartholomew ogbeche played in kavala
‚Ä¢ marco livaja played in aek
‚Ä¢ rivaldo played in both olympiakos and aek



i made this team to get the remaining rivals matches to the next milestone so i can get some packs, i played 8 games with the team so here's a review!

i used the 4222 formation with marco livaja and rivaldo as the strikers, ogbeche and verde the two cams of the team. the midfield and defence is like you imagine it. 

jos√© s√° was surprisingly solid, made some mad saves.

the defence was solid i can say, essien was the sweeper and semedo was the destroyer, *criminaly* underated (üòâ) leovac was terrible and vinagre was all right, better as a winger than a fullback lol.

the midfield consists of passion. danilo has the reach but not the pace and gattuso doesn't have neither of those two, both have *passion* though, that's all that matters in the greek superleague.

the attack is the highlight of the team obviously. marco livaja is the mvp and proves why he has such a big dick, scored most of my goals and played very good. rivaldo set up most of livaja's goals while scoring some bangers with his brazilian finesse. ogbeche was very underwhelmed as he's not good at anything particular. his physical is high but he's short, his shooting is good but i played his out wide anyway, his pace is meh, even his workrates are medium/medium! daniele verde on the other hand is very good, very fast and has great dribbling. his shooting is very solid too. 

overall i had so much fun with this team, can't wait for next year where yaya toure, sidney govou and smolarek will get added just for my greek superleague past team, thanks ea! (abidal, cambiasso and some greek icon would be cool)",a review of my greek superleague past only team!

2) do you use second man press? for me it seems counter productive to be honest. 8 cases out of 10. let me clarify: it either marks the player which just chases the opponent and that is it. when it's close i press tackle but it doesn't do anything.  and the worst part is that it start doing a weird move when marked, so that 1 second makes a distance between the player and the opponent even longer. 

3) is there a way to check accurate lag during the game?",couple of simple questions regarding the game:

DesignerExitSign,FIFA,"some background in why this unorthodox idea makes sense:

haaland has the ‚Äúextreme hunchback‚Äù body type. in the current meta, this body type is really desirable for defenders, such as koulibaly or milito (i think). however, there‚Äôs less talk about the attacking capabilities of these body type. for one, something about the passing animation is different than other players passing. it‚Äôs more direct, has no curve to it, and it doesn‚Äôt get intercepted. it‚Äôs also extremely hard to take the ball off these players they press r2. i‚Äôve wanted a player with the extreme hunchback body type as a cm for the longest time and i was right, it‚Äôs the best possible option for a midfielder.


l‚Äôm playing him with an artist and stay forward, get into the box for cross. due to the strength, speed, and his body type, i can literally just sprint at players and he muscles them off, or will make the opponents defensive shape completely disorganized. his attacking ai is not just top from the st or cm position, but he also receives the pass better than any other player. due to all these facts, his dribbling success rate each game is the best on the pitch between me and my opponent. 

cons: obviously, you loose a lot of defensive capabilities with him. however, he‚Äôs still not too bad if you‚Äôre a smart defensive player; due to his long legs and large body, he‚Äôs good at stealing and 1 on 1s. you will have to manually bring him back often though, something you need to be used to.

obviously i can‚Äôt leave you with this wall of text without backing it up. here‚Äôs the typical goals you‚Äôll get with him: https://imgur.com/a/sfawpxf",psa: 98 haaland is the best attacking cm in the game

there's 9 shapeshifters that i've never packed and, coupled with sitting on a large amount of coins and nowhere to put them, i decided to combine some coins with time and effort and go hunting for them via the shapeshifter pp sbc.

the players i was looking for:  99 cr7  98 ginola, kante  97 marcelo, rashford  96 werner  95 grealish, valverde, walker

i've been lucky enough to pack messi (from 86+ pp), ribery (sb rewards) and all the others but not once have i seen the players above despite doing every 85x10, all the swaps fodder packs, getting all gg cup rewards, and many, many other packs/picks. surely 50 picks, totaling 150 players, will unearth some of  these elusive cards.... *results**

the table below shows all the players that appeared across the 50 picks, the number of times they appeared in each position, and the total times they appeared.

|el shaarawy|0|0|1|1| *takeaways**  34 of the 56 ss players showed up at least once. 22 did not.  the only cards rated 96 or higher to make an appearance were cordoba (4 times), cole (3), and davies (2).  out of the 9 players i'd never packed, only 1 showed up (once) throughout the 150 players across these 50 picks - grealish - and that was in pick number 49.  gomez was, surprisingly, not the most common player to show up - that honour goes to ljungberg (appeared 11 times), although gomez wasn't too far behind on 9.  gomez's propensity for only appearing in the first slot was consistent across these picks - he appeared 9 times and always in the first slot. similarly, ljungberg's 11 appearances were all in the 3rd slot. *cost**

although the sbc cost on futbin would suggest 50 picks would cost close to 2m, it really only cost me about 400k. the reason for this is i'd recycle the players i got from the picks into more picks (crafting 5 at a time), adding one tots and 9 gold players to each one. about two-thirds of the tots came from my club stock, with the rest bought off the market for between 11-13k each. the majority of the golds i purchased off the market on bid for between 650-750 each.

breakdown cost for each pick:  recycled ss player - ""free""  tots player - \~13k  9 gold players (on bid, not bin) - \~6k  total: \~19k *summary**

i did 50 shapeshifter player picks, spending around 400k and burning through some club fodder, and have a single ss grealish card to show for it. worth it! (^(not..))",results from 50 shapeshifters player picks

kirschbaum12345,FIFA,"ea announced that there will be changes in fut champions.

what are your wishes for fut 23 champions ?

mine are:

1. better rewards, promo players in pick instead of totw players and also better pack value in the packs

2. change to another point system. they have to go back to ..... wins instead of that point system,

3. quitting at 0-0 must give the player who did it, a loss

4. remove the qualifyier

5. extend the wl for 1-2 days",fifa 23 fut champions wishlist

JamesHowell91,FIFA,"why do traders get so much hate in the fifa community - there‚Äôs a common misconception that traders negatively influence or control the market.

traders probably make up less than 1% of the coins on the market.

let‚Äôs be clear - ea control the market. they control supply through pack weights and they control demand through their programming of the game and its meta and sbcs.

the fact is at certain points of the game trading is just as fun as playing and the vitriol spouted towards some traders on other threads about people holding 10-15 fut captain or birthday cards is so far wide of the mark. those hoarded cards make up a tiny fraction of what‚Äôs out there.

the problem is the content is shite and people who have them in their clubs have probably stopped playing who could sell but also most importantly - ea has made a huge balls up by leaving them out of packs.",why do ‚Äòtraders‚Äô get so much hate?

cylee6,FIFA,"i pretty much have my end-game team, and i've complained about how bad preseason 1 cards are compared to futties batch 3 (and 2 even).  i honestly barely did the 85x10 last week, as there really wasn't a single card i wanted (already did every futties/preseason card).  i did the 85x10 this week to do haaland and rudiger, but i really didn't have much else to do with it.  

so when it was released 10x today, i figured ""what the hell"" and i wanted to see how far it would go.  here's how it went:

first, i took my 8 dupes (ranging from 85 - 94) went into doing diego carlos and 1 85x10.

then i took that 85x10, and with minimal purchase (i twice bought emiliano martinez for 3.2k each time), i did the 10 highest-rated squads of the ruud gullit sbc, which is 2 90s, 2 89s, 3 88s, and 3 87s.  the cycle was basically:

\- open the 85x10

\- take the dupes and the gold cards from the 85x10 and throw it into the gullit sbc, usually with 5-6 high rated cards (88+) and the rest low rated gold commons.

\- open the tradeable pack from the sbc to refresh your gold cards, during which you'll get a decent amount of specials too; 

\- do another 85x10

\- rinse and repeat.

combined, with carlos + 10 squads of gullit, that is close to 900k in fodder value according to futbin.  and, i spent about 7k total in coins, and made that back easily from selling consumables i got from the various packs.  

obviously, results will vary.  but the best card i got in the set of 10 was 97 modric, and i kept a few cards for my usa team (turner/zimmerman), so it's not like i was going crazy on these.   just wanted to share, in case you're thinking about doing a very expensive sbc and wondering how far these can take you.  notably, i did have a pretty stocked club of high-end cards, but i honestly didn't use anything over a 94 (unless it was a dupe) to do any of these.  so, if you're looking to do a pele, dinho, r9, etc this might give you an idea of how that compares to futbin prices.  

last note: the best thing i got in all my packs was a st-cf position modifier.",the 85x10 (x 10) = approximately 800k worth of fodder

but with futties sbcs all expiring within about the next 2 weeks we still wouldnt be able to complete them without grinding the insanely poor value futties all batches pp.

i'd love to complete all the remaining futties sbcs but not sure who to prioritise as only have enough specials for one. do i go for mendy as he expires within 2 days? or salah now cause he's the much better card?

but what i really mean is id love the headers/ tall players to be good this year, 

just because there seems like there‚Äôs such a good amount of players that can play like this now too, the prem is a prime example 

toney, mitro, moore, solanke, mateta, isak, scamacca, nunez, jimenez, dcl, haaland, ronaldo, kane. recently now maybe even kalajdzic joining wolves

especially with the introduction of crouch as a hero too

even out inside of the prem there‚Äôs 

haller, lukaku, vlahovic, schick, modeste, zapata, abraham, ajorque, immobile

it's unrealistic. it's broken. and it's the most boring thing i've ever experienced in a video game.

basically, i pre-ordered fifa 23 earlier today, and, when i went to pay, it asked me for the usual bank authorization token, which i took care of, and, after that, the payment window just went blank. i waited about five minutes to see if it would return some sort of confirmation message like ""payment successful"", but no, nothing. so i refreshed the page and it just took me back to the origin homepage.

so i checked the status of my order on their help page and it said ""pending payment"". i then went and spoke to someone on their live chat and they basically said that payment would only be deducted a week prior to game release and that my pre-order had been successful, but, knowing it's ea and their live chat, i am not fully convinced the guy got it right. i still can't see the game on my games tab (i don't know if i am supposed to at this point).

has anyone else who has bought the game on origin had similar issues when pre-ordering? is the game showing up on your games tab, even if locked until the release?
